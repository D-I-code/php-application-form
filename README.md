Web application form created using PHP, HTML, CSS, SQL and MAMP PRO.

The idea of the project is to allow the user to apply for a job role by entering user information like Name, Surname, Email, Telephone number, Address and Post code. The user can also select their gender and upload a file (CV/Resume), restricted to ".pdf" or ".docx" type. A comment field is also included, allowing the user to write text, explaining why they would be a good fit for the job role. 

All the user's information is saved in a SQL database and a record is kept. All users have unique IDs that are auto generated by the system. The information won't be uploaded to the database until all fields are completed, and if the form is submitted with an empty field a red line error message appears at the top end of the screen, alerting the user to check their incomplete form. I have used phpMyAdmin for the creation of the database and table.
